    <h2> Merol is back! </h2>

    <h4 class="oText"> CHANGELOG </h4>

    <h4 class="oText"> ---Moving to Repl.it--- <br><br> By far the hardest change was deciding to change platform and in the process, rewrite most of the commands to fit a new, more dynamic handler. It took a long time, but we can assure it was worth it! <br><br><br><br> ---New Syntax Changes--- <br><br> Commands can no longer have spaces in their names (ex, Help Keys is now HelpKeys. etc) <br><br> Longer commands now have short aliases for easy access (ex, for UserInfo you can simply use UI, to see aliases, check the command section) <br><br> RandEmote now accepts options from x2 to x30 instead of only x3 and x9. <br><br> Enable Keys and Disable Keys were merged into GetKeys, (as well as the server variant for mods, GetServerKeys) <br><br> Enable React and Disable React were merged into GetReact, which now opens a menu where you can set your Custom Reaction yourself easily!!! <br><br> To get (or remove), a server's Custom Role, you now must use GetRole. <br><br> Set Role and Remove Role were merged into SetRole. <br><br> Set Channel and Remove Channel were merged into SetChannel. <br><br> The commands section must reflect all these changes. <br><br><br><br> ---Temporarily Disabled Commands--- <br><br> Wikidex, Randchara and Ship Commands are disabled until these are fully rewritten <br><br><br><br> ---(Likely) Scrapped Commands--- <br><br> RandOST and RandCover no longer have a Play version (connection to Voice Chat seems like a little too heavy for the bot as of now...) </h4>

    <h2> We are sorry for the wait!, It has been a long time, our work is far from done, but we hope you enjoy the progress we have made!, We are very happy to see you use the bot after a long time! </h2>

    <h2> The lucky key system </h2>

    <h4 class="oText"> When you send a message, there is a small chance that Merol DM's you, if that happens, that means you got a lucky key! <br><br> When you reach certain amount of keys, you can ask the bot in DMs for a prize and you won't lose those keys. <br><br> For example, when you reach 10, you can ask certain servers for a special role, when you get 35, you can ask for a special reaction, for more details, use "mrl!help keys". </h4>

    <h4 class="oText"> The newest updates allows you to play a few jokes by spending some keys, like fake drops from other bots or having a channel flooded by random reactions. <br> </h4>

    <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/541345931870732290.gif" title="No. clicking this image won't give you keys.  ̶ ̶S̶a̶d̶l̶y̶">

    <h3> If you do not want to get any more keys, use the "disable keys" command. </h3>

    <h3> Due to the nature of most prizes, you cannot give keys to someone else. <br> The Merol staff team reserves the right to give free keys. </h3>

    <h2> DMs: A channel just for Merol and You </h2>

    <h4 class="oText"> Your DMs with Merol are not only to receive keys, most of the commands can be used in there, and it's the perfect place to clear your doubts about the bot, because if you send her a message, you might get a reply from the Merol staff team. <br><br> No, she is not sentient. Or atleast not while we are looking. </h4>

    <h4 class="oText"> If you keep gettiing "❌" reactions in your DMs sent to Merol, it means we are no longer reading anything you send, this can be because of NSFW content or rude behaviour. If you want to appeal, we still read what you send with the "IMP" command. </h4>
